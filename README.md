### Mock Data Producer
Keep generating mock sales data for later analysis.

### Kafka
Core of the data pipeline. Has 3 topics for input data: `invoice`, `product`, `customer`. With some other topics for transformed data.

### Kafka Streams (To Do)
Pre-transform data in real-time. Perform the early anomaly detection and alert.

### MySQL
The database in the data pipeline.

### Airflow
Schedule hourly/daily tasks for more detailed analysis and reports.

### Spark
The Spark cluster receives submitted jobs from Airflow.

## How to use
Run the start script:
`. bin/start.sh`

## To Do List
- [ ] More reasonable mock data
- [ ] Kafka Streams anomaly detection
- [ ] Per customer analysis
- [x] Daily sales statistics analysis
